# Model Fit Assessment for Dynamic Structural Equation Models: Frequentist vs. Bayesian Alternatives

### Authors: Holger Brandt, Mihai Falcusan, Kim Zierahn

Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM) has become a powerful tool for analyzing
Intensive Longitudinal Data (ILD), particularly in clinical and health psychology. While
Bayesian estimation offers advantages for modeling dynamic processes, the lack of robust
model fit assessment methods remains a critical limitation. This study investigates the
performance of frequentist and Bayesian model fit indices in detecting misspecifications in
DSEM. Through an extensive simulation study, we examine the sensitivity to detect misfit
of commonly used fit indices — including RMSEA, CFI, TLI, and χ2/df — across different
sample sizes and number of time points. Our findings indicate that TLI and χ2/df perform
best in balancing Type I error rates and power to detect model misfit. However, existing fit
indices struggle with complex DSEM structures, underscoring the need for novel methods
incorporating time-dependent assumptions. We discuss implications for future research,
including the development of new indices and automated model selection approaches to
improve model fit evaluation in DSEM
